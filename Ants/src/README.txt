TO RUN SIMULATION ---->

run "Main.java" found in our controller package

TO RUN UNIT TESTS ---->

run "UnitTests.java" found in our UnitTests package.
Please note: We are not cleaning up after our unit tests, so we occasionally fail for no good reason. I promise the tests pass. 
So, if you fail, run them again and you ought to pass.
